Introduction to Javascript
## What is Javascrpt?
A scripting languagethat allows web developers to implement interactivesness and very complex features on web pages. When you see web animations, interactive maps, infinite scrolls amongst many other things, we can bet that there is some involvement of Javascript.
<br><br>javascript acts as the third layer of standard web techgnologies after HTML and CSS.<br><br>
## Variables
Javascript has containers, known as variables that must be declared and used to store data that you will refer to at some point in your web programme. Javascript variables can be declare in 5 ways:
- var            - Refers to the container being declared/created to store specific information.
- let            - Also a variable declaration, difference is that "let" is block-scoped and a local variable 
- const          - Declares block-scoped local variables, difference is that the value of a constant can/does not change. A constant is an object that has properties that can only be added, updated and/or removed.
- automatically  - Declares global variables that can be accessed anywhere at anytime in the program. i.e, if we forget to type "var, let, and const" javascript will declare it automatically and assign the type of content stored on the that variable.
